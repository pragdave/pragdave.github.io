title: What I'm Up To

### Writing

Currently finishing off a book project that I'm hoping will make a
splash!

### Coding

* Getting familiar with the ES8266 controllers
* Seeing if I can write code in Elixir to interface to an OBD port in my
  car

### Looking At

* Gleam language for Beam

### Messin' Around

* Slowly getting better at wood turning. Working out a workflow for
  getting bubble-free epoxy resin inlays: current best bet seems to be
  vacuum degassing the resin, then pouring, then heatlamp.

#### Tools I'm Using

Hardware
  : Back to the Mac. In the end my one-year Linux experiment was great,
    but the alternatives to the tools I use (Adobe Premiere, PS, and AI,
    Graffle, and ScreenFlow) were not quite there. It's a shame: in many
    ways Linux is now the nicest overall OS to use.

  : I'm on a 6x2 core i7 MBP with an old Intuos tablet. I steal one of
    my kids' old screens as an occasional second monitor .

Content creation
  : Adobe Premier Pro, Audacity, Illustrator, Photoshop. Omnigraffle,
  Quicktime, Numbers, Keynote. I wish I could find a simple animation package. Skim for
  PDF reading.

Editor
  : After 30 years with Emacs, I'm now using Visual Studio Code. It's
  faster than Emacs, and it just works. And students appreciate the fact
  that I'm using something familiar.

Utilities
  : * BetterTouchTool: so I can reconfigure the ridiculous touch bar
      (which I keep hitting with my pinkies when I'm typing). I'm also
      using its window management stuff to let me tile and move things
      around (including a really useful "throw to other display"
      keyboard shortcut.

  : * Git: for just about everything: my driving value is is "if my
      machine melts overnight, I want to be back where I was by that
      afternoon?"

  : * Jekyll: for my website. LetsEncrypt/CertBot for keys.

  : * Ruby: for general scripting
