      <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>I first used Linux in the early 90’s (I think it was 0.99.pl9), and I
continued to use it pretty much exclusively for over a decade. Back
then, though, most Linux developers spent more time maintaining their
operating system as they did writing code. Network interfaces, printers,
displays: if you could plug it in, you’d probably end up downloading
patches and drivers, and recompiling the OS multiple times. Even so,
like growing old, it was better than the available alternatives.</p>

<p>OS X 10 came out around 2001. I didn’t really consider it for a while,
thinking it was mostly a consumer device. But when they started turning
up on the podiums at conferences, I looked again, then took the plunge.</p>

<p>It took a little while, but I came to realize that life in the walled
garden was sweet. No more kernel builds, because Apple controlled both
the OS and the hardware. I could compile (most) all my Linux tools, and
I was productive. More productive than I had been with Linux.</p>

<p>I’d was a loyal Mac user (both desktop
and laptop). I’ve probably bought 8 or more machines. For a long time, I
felt they were the best hardware out there.</p>

<p>But after 14 or so years, that was no longer the case. The Air was
probably the last revolutionary machine they made. After that, it seemed
largely incremental.</p>

<p>So I started looking around. I bought a Samsung NP940X3L laptop with Windows 10,
and tried to use it for development. Even with the bash shell, it seemed
like a struggle: files were spread seemingly at random over the file
system, the GUI was totally confusing, and the damn thing kept wanting
to reboot to install some security patch. I was bummed, because the new
Surface Book looks sweet.</p>

<p>Anyway, I repartioned the hard drive and installed Ubuntu 15.something.
It booted fine but it was pretty much unusable: it didn’t handle the
touchscreen without a patch, the scaling for the 3200x1800 display was
totally inconsistent, and, yes, I had to install new drivers for the
WiFi adapter.</p>

<p>So I lent to Samsung to my oldest son and went back to the Mac.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks back, he started a back-end programming course at Jeff
Casimir’s Turing.io. He no longer needed the laptop, so I thought I’d
try again.</p>

<p>I reformatted the Linux partition, and installed Ubuntu 17.10. And that
was it: it just worked. In fact, I think every feature of the laptop I
wanted to use was available with no effort on my part.</p>

<p>I wrote a trivil Ansible playbook to set things up (because otherwise
I’d never remember) and used git to clone my dotfiles. I needed a couple
of changes to some of the paths, but otherwise things just worked.</p>

<p>Over time, I had to make a few adjustments. I want to use Fira Code as
my coding font, but Gnome’s terminal doesn’t support ligatures, so I
went with Konsole. I’m still experimenting with alternatives to
Spotlight for searching for files with particular content.</p>

<p>But, so far, I’ve been really happy. I don’t use the touch screen much
when I’m just coding, but I’ve found it’s a great tool when I’m sitting
next to someone exploring ideas.</p>

<p>I’m going to give it 6 months</p>
