      <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>I read a lot of aviation magazines. In every one, you’ll find at least
one column dedicated to reporting on accidents. These reports are
fairly dry: a restatement of the facts issued by the various
government agencies that investigate transportation
problems. Depressingly, a large number end with the summary “pilot
error.”</p>

<p>Are our pilots a bunch of cowboys, recklessly flying planes in to the
ground? Quite the reverse, the vast majority are conservative, careful
aviators. So why does “pilot error” figure so prominently?</p>

<p>The authorities quite rightly give the pilot of an aircraft ultimate
authority over that aircraft’s operation. It’s up to the pilot to
check the weather, the condition of the plane, the distribution of
weight, the fuel required, and many other factors, all before setting
foot inside the plane. Once flying, the pilot’s job continues,
monitoring weather, fuel remaining, aircraft performance, navigation,
collision avoidance: the list is long and complex.</p>

<p>It isn’t easy keeping all these factors balanced, particularly not
when the weather is closing in, fuel is starting to look marginal,
turbulence is jarring your teeth loose and you’re at the end of a
long, exhausting day. And yet we all (quite rightly) expect our pilots
to maintain a level of near perfection. So pilots, being human, make
mistakes, and sometimes these mistakes have tragic consequences.</p>

<p>That’s where the accident reports come in. Pilots read them, and read
them avidly. They aren’t reading to gloat. They’re reading to
learn. The pilots they’re reading about are for the most part every
bit as careful as they are, and yet still something went wrong. So
pilots read the reports to find out what happened, and maybe to try to
tune their personal procedures to stop it happening to them. By
reading these reports, pilots improve both their own performance and
aviation’s overall safety.</p>

<p>Computer programming is perhaps half the age of powered flight. We
face different issues; our mistakes can cause inconvenience, but
rarely loss of life. But perhaps still there’s something that
programmers can learn from the attitudes of pilots. Is it conceivable
that we might one day have a way for developers to report problems
during development to some anonymous forum so that others might learn?
Could we start to use our own history as a tool to help us all
improve?</p>
