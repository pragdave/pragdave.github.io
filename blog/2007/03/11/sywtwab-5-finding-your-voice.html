<p>This is the fifth of a series of personal notes to people who may be
thinking of writing (or who have embarked upon writing) a book. You’ll
be able to find them all (eventually) by selecting the tag <a href="http://pragdave.pragprog.com/pragdave/writing_a_book/index.html">Writing
A Book</a>.</p>

<p>So far we’ve discussed the idea that a book is a narrative, and that
the reader is the hero, undertaking a journey to learn new things (to
boldly go…). I suggested that you might even want to start your book
with an explicit story, something to draw the reader in. So just how
do you write in such a way that the reader wants to join you? I don’t
pretend to know, but there are some tricks that pragmatic authors use.</p>

<p>First and foremost, always remember that the book is about the reader,
not the writer. Your job as author is to help the reader become
proficient. You are a mentor, a guide. So always invite the reader
along as you explore and explain.</p>

<p>The consistent use of pronouns is a great start. As the author, don’t
try to hide behind a passive or stuffy voice. Don’t say “It is widely
believed that…”. Don’t say “One could argue that…”. Just come out and
say it: “I think that…”. Engage with your reader.</p>

<p>Your reader is a person too, so address them directly. Say things such
as “You’ll need to install Xyz now” and “If you run the code now,
you’ll see the following output.”.</p>

<p>But remember, you’re sharing a journey. So, whenever possible, try to
use “we” and “our” to refer to the reader/author team. Don’t start a
chapter with “In this chapter I’ll show you…”. Don’t start with “In
this chapter you’ll find out…”. Instead, join the reader as they
learn: “In this chapter we’ll see how…”.</p>

<p>Remember what I said about the Dreyfus model in
<a href="/blog/2007/03/07/sywtwab-3-the-heros-journey-are-you-experienced/">SYWTBAW 3</a>?
Novices want to be told what to do. So don’t be afraid to use
the imperative voice, particular early on the the book.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of paragraphs from the Rails book.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Back in xxxxx we sketched out the basic content of the products
table. Now let’s turn that into reality. We need to create a database
table and a Rails model that lets our application use that table.</p>

  <p>The
migration has a sequence number prefix (001), a name
(create_products) and the file extension (.rb, because it’s a Ruby
program). Let’s add the code to this file that creates the table in
the database. Go to the db/migrate directory and open the file
001_create_products.rb. You’ll see two Ruby methods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See how the reader and author share the journey: “We need to create”,
“Let’s add the code”, and so on. At the same time, the reader is told
what to do: “Go to the …” and “open the file”.</p>

<p>Layered on top of all these tricks with pronouns, the book has to be
readable and engaging. You need to find a way of injecting energy and
passion into your writing. You have to make people want to turn the
page, to learn more about your subject. Clearly, technical knowledge
helps. A good turn of phrase can make the content more
interesting. Light, casual humor (particularly if it is off-beat or
subtle) can keep the reader on his or her toes. Adding the occasional
piece of trivia or background can add a little spice.</p>

<p>But all of this is predicated on one truth: the voice of a book has to
be your voice. It has to be genuine; it has to be you. This is
probably the most difficult challenge an author faces on a new book
project.</p>

<p>So—how can you find this voice?</p>

<p>My best advice is to look at your book’s content and choose a chapter
where you’re really comfortable with the technical material. Then just
sit down and start writing. Write without reviewing what you’ve
written. Don’t look back and correct stuff. Just write. Keep going for
as long as you can. When you stop, save the file without rereading
it. The next day, keep on writing. And continue the day after that. At
some point, something will click in your head. You’ll find your
writing style suddenly gels. Your prose will start to flow and the
words will start to hang together well. You’ll know the feeling when
it happens.</p>

<p>And when it does, here’s what you do. Save the file you’ve been
working on, and promise yourself you won’t look at it again for a
long, long time. Instead, choose another chapter and start
writing. This time, you’re writing for real. Still keep the flow
going, but now it’s OK (actually, it’s vital) to go back and read what
you wrote. Ask the <a href="/blog/2007/03/08/sywtwab-4-readers-on-your-shoulders/">readers on your
shoulder</a> what
they think. Because now you’re writing a book for real.</p>

<p>At some point you’ll have to revisit that original chapter. My advice?
Just throw away the one you wrote initially and do it again. It’ll
come out infinitely better than it would if you tried to make
incremental improvements to your original prose.</p>

<p>When I write a new book, I follow this approach. I plan to throw away
something like the first 30 or so pages. And, because I know I’m going
to do it, it doesn’t worry me. I no longer have writer’s block. I no
longer agonize over the voice in the first paragraph. I just churn it
out until I feel comfortable, delete everything I wrote, and then
start in for real.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959/">The
Mythical Man Month</a>, Fred Brooks advises project teams to expect to
“throw the first one away.” That’s still good advice after 25 years,
and it applies just as much to the writing process as it does to
software development.</p>

<p>Give yourself time. Give your book a voice.</p>
