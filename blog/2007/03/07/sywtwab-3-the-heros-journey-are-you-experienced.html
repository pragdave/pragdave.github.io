<p>This is the third of a series of personal notes to people who may be
thinking of writing (or who have embarked upon writing) a book. You’ll
be able to find them all (eventually) by selecting the tag <a href="http://pragdave.pragprog.com/pragdave/writing_a_book/index.html">Writing A Book</a>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://pragdave.pragprog.com/pragdave/2007/03/sywtwab_2_the_h.html">last post</a> on writing we looked at the idea that a technical book can
have a narrative, and that a good book will allow the reader to
identify with the hero of that narrative.</p>

<p>However, there’s more to this narrative business that just girding
your loins, sharpening your blade, and traipsing off after
dragons. You also have to allow your hero to develop. A hero starts
off uncertain, and will take whatever small victories that she or he
can take. As the hero gains confidence, she’ll start to take on bigger
(and often more ambiguous) foes. Battles will use more dexterity and
wits, and less brute strength.</p>

<p>In technical writing, this gaining of experience is explained by the
Dreyfus Model of Skills Acquisition.</p>

<p>Andy and I were introduced to this concept by Andy’s wife. At that
time she was a nurse practitioner. One of the core books during her
education was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Novice-Expert-Excellence-Clinical-Commemorative/dp/0130325228/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-4114323-6751127?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1173324281&amp;sr=8-1">From Novice to Expert</a> by Patricia Benner. This book used a
psychological model developed by the Dreyfus brothers to explain the
process by which people gain experience when learning a new
skill. Before Dreyfus, it was assumed that gaining experience was a
bit like filling the gas tank in your car: your brain starts out empty
and, as you pour information in through your eyes and ears, the
experience dial gradually creeps up.</p>

<p>The Dreyfus brothers showed that this is not the case. They
demonstrated that people pass through different levels as they become
experienced. Each level has different characteristics. At the early
levels, people don’t want lots of theory and can’t tolerate
ambiguity. They want to be told what to do to achieve a goal, and they
want to see lots of short-term successes. (If you’re about to jump out
of a plane for the first time, you’re probably more interested in
which handle you pull, and when, than in the history and philosophy of
skydiving). However, as you gain experience, your needs change. You
start needing to put information into a broader context, and to apply
it in your own way. You become less rules based, and more
intuitive. (This is why really experienced developers often talk to
each other using metaphors—the ambiguityand imagery in a metaphor
allows them to communicate nuances better).</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, these ideas are crucial to understand when plotting
your technical book. Your reader starts out inexperienced when it
comes to the content of your book. That’s why it is <strong>always</strong> a
mistake to start out with a chapter listing the history of your
technology, the philosophy of the design, the quirks of the inventors,
and other worthy, tedious topics. At this point, the reader doesn’t
give a toss about any of it. Instead, they want to know: what can I
do? Now?</p>

<p>Start your book with simple examples. Make them interesting (and
probably a little humorous to help break the tension) but make the
examples relevant. Make you readers feel as if they are achieving
something as they work through each. You can use your technology’s
jargon, but use it sparingly, and only to explain what it means. If
you have exercises, make them follow the same pattern; early exercises
should be simple, with a single, well-understood point. They should
take 15–20 minutes to complete, and it should be obvious to the reader
when they’ve succeeded.</p>

<p>As the book progresses, ramp up the challenges. The text can start to
make assumptions about the reader’s level of experience—after all, the
preceding chapters of the book have helped them gain that
experience. You can start to make the descriptions broader, and the
challenges more open ended. This is a good time to start using the
technology’s jargon in context. (If you do this, it doesn’t hurt to
reinforce the definitions every now and then in a subtle way:
“Remember how we described the way that singleton methods are specific
to a particular object? That is reflected in the way we define them…”)
Exercises can be more open ended, perhaps with no particular correct
answer. The pace can pick up.</p>

<p>By the end of the book, your tone becomes collegial. Your reader is
becoming your peer, and you can start treating them that way. Their
graduation from the book is an invitation to join your world.</p>

<p>The Dreyfus model contains nothing revolutionary. Instead, it
describes an evolution—<strong>the evolution from novice to expert</strong>. This
is another aspect of the hero’s journey your reader will take.</p>
