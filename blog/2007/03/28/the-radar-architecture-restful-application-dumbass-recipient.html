<p>Roy Fielding’s <a href="http://roy.gbiv.com/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">REST</a> work
showed us that the design of the interaction between a client and a
server could make a major difference to the reliability and
scalability of that application. If you follow a set of conventions
embodied in REST when designing your application, is means that (for
example) the network will be able to cache responses to certain
requests, offloading work from both upstream network components and
from the application.</p>

<p>But REST was about more than performance. It offered a way of
separating the actions performed by your applications (the verbs) from
the things acted upon (the nouns, or in REST terms,
the <em>resources</em>). What’s more, REST said that the verbs that you use
should apply consistently across all your resources.</p>

<p>When using HTTP, the HTTP verbs (such as GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE)
are also the verbs that should be used with REST applications. This
makes a lot of sense, because things like routers and proxies also
understand these verbs.</p>

<p>One of the successes built using these principles is the <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/">Atom Publishing
Protocol</a>. Atom allows clients to fetch, edit, and publish web
resources. Atom is probably most commonly applied to allow people to
use local editors to create and maintain blog articles—client software
on the user’s computer uses Atom to fetch existing articles and to
save back edited or new articles.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how that happens with Atom.</p>

<p>I fire up my Atom-based local client. It needs to fetch the updated
list of all the articles currently on the server, so it issues a GET
request to a URL that represents the collection of articles: the verb
is GET, and the resource is the collection.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>GET   /articles

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>What comes back is a list of resources. Included with each resource
are one or two URIs. One of these URIs can be used to access that
resource for editing. Let’s say I want to edit a particular
article. First, my client software will fetch it, using the URI given
in the collection:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>GET   /article/123

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As a user of the editing software, I then see a nicely formatted
version of the article. If I click the <code class="highlighter-rouge">[EDIT]</code>button, that view
changes: I now see text boxes, drop down lists, text areas, and so
on. I can now change the article’s contents. When I press <code class="highlighter-rouge">[SAVE]</code>,
the local application then packages up the changed article and sends
it back to the server using a PUT request. The use of PUT says “update
an existing resource with this new stuff.”</p>

<h3 id="browsers-are-dumb">Browsers are Dumb</h3>

<p>If you use a browser to interact with a server, you’re using a
half-duplex, forms-based device. The host sends down a form, you fill
in the form, and send it back when you’re ready. This turns out to be
really convenient for people running networks and servers. Because
HTTP is stateless, and because applications talk to browsers using a
fire-and-forget model, your servers and networks can handle very large
numbers of devices. This is exactly the architecture that IBM
championed back in the 70s. The half-duplex, poll-select nature of
3270-based applications allowed mainframes with less processing power
than a modern toaster to handle tens of thousands of simultaneous
users. The browser is really not much better than a 3270 (except the
resolution is better when displaying porn). (Recently, folks have been
trying to circumvent this simplicity by making browser-based
applications more interactive using technologies such as Ajax. To my
mind, this is just a stop-gap until we throw the browser away
altogether—Ajax is just lipstick on a pig.)</p>

<p>How well do browsers play in a RESTful world?</p>

<p>Well, for a start, they really only use two of the HTTP verbs: GET and
POST. Is this a problem? Yes and no.</p>

<p>We can always hack around the lack of verbs by embedding the verb that
you <em>wanted</em> to use somewhere in the request that you send to the
server. It can be embedded in the URL that you use to access a
resource or it can be embedded in the body of the request (for example
as an element of the POST data). Both work, assuming the server
understands the conventions. But both techniques also mean that you’re
not using REST and the HTTP verb set; you’re simply using HTTP as a
transport with your own protocol layered on top. And that means that
the network is less able to do clever things to optimize your traffic.</p>

<p>But a browser talking HTML over HTTP is also lacking in another
important area. It isn’t running any application functionality
locally. Remember our Atom-based blogging client? It had smarts, and
so it knew how to display an article for editing. Browsers don’t have
that (without a whole lot of support in terms of bolted on Javascript
or Flash). So, as a result, people using RESTful ideas to talk to
browsers have to put the smarts back on the server. They invent new
URLs which (for example) return a resource, but return it all wrapped
up in the HTML needed to display it as a form for browser-based
editing. This is how Rails does it. Using the Rails conventions, if I
want to fetch an article for viewing on a browser, I can use</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>GET   /article/1

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If, instead, I want to allow the user to edit the resource, I issue</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>  GET  /article/1;edit

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The application then sends down a form pre-populated with the data
from that article. When I hit submit, the form contents are sent back
to the server, along with a hidden field that tells the server to
pretend that the HTTP POST request is actually a RESTful PUT
request—the result is that the resource is updated on the server.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">;xxx</code> notation looks like it was tacked on. I think that in this
case, looks aren’t deceiving—these modifiers really were something of
an afterthought, added when it became apparent that a pure Atom-like
protocol actually wouldn’t do everything needed in a real-world
browser-based web application. That’s because the client of an Atom
server is assumed to be more that just a display device. An Atom
client would not say “fetch me this resource and (oh, by the way) send
it down as a form so that I can edit it.” The client would just say
GET, do what it had to do, then issue a PUT.</p>

<p>So, in pure REST, the client is a peer (or maybe even in charge) of
the interchange. But when talking to a dumb browser, the client is no
better than an intermediary between the human and the
application. That’s why it was necessary to add things such
as <code class="highlighter-rouge">;edit</code>.</p>

<h3 id="client-independent-applications">Client-independent Applications</h3>

<p>One of the other benefits of designing your applications against the
limited verbs offered by HTTP REST is that you can (in theory) support
many different clients with the same application code. You could write
blogging server that (for example) looked at the HTTP <code class="highlighter-rouge">Accepts</code> header
when deciding what to send back to a client. The response to a GET
request to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/articles</code> could be a nicely formatted HTML page if the
client wants an HTML response, an XML payload if the client asks for
XML, or an Atom collection if the client asks
for <code class="highlighter-rouge">application/atomcoll+xml</code>. In Rails terms, this is handled by
the<code class="highlighter-rouge">respond_to</code> stanza that is duplicated in each controller action of
a RESTful server.</p>

<p>But the benefits run deeper than simply being able to serve up
different styles of response.</p>

<p>The HTTP verb set maps (with a little URL tweaking) pretty nicely onto
the database verb set. POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE get mapped to the
database CRUD verbs: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.</p>

<p>So, in theory at least, you should be able to write your application
code as a fairly thin veneer over a set of resources. The application
exports the verbs to manipulate the resources and the clients have fun
accessing them. This is similar to the vision of <a href="http://nakedobjects.org/wiki/Main_Page">Naked Objects</a>.</p>

<p>However, I personally think it was optimistic to try to treat the two
styles of interaction (smart and dumb clients) using the same
protocol. The ugliness of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">;xxx</code> appendages was a hint.</p>

<p>I think there’s a lot of merit in following a CRUD-based model for
interacting with your application’s resources. I’m not convinced all
the hassle of bending dumb browser interactions into a REST-based set
of verbs, and then extending those verbs to make it work, is worth the
extra hassle. To put it another way, I believe the discipline and
conventions imposed by thinking of your application interface as a
RESTful one are worthwhile. They lead to cleaner and
easier-to-understand designs. The hoops you have to jump through to
implement it with a browser as a client seem to suggest that a slavish
adherence to the protocol might be trying to push it too far.</p>

<h3 id="an-alternative-model">An Alternative Model</h3>

<p>Does that mean I’m down on the RESTful, CRUD based approach to
application development? Not at all. For some categories of
application, I think it’s a great way of structuring your code. But
REST isn’t designed for talking to people. So let’s accept that fact
when creating applications. And, while we’re at it, let’s take
advantage of the fact that HTTP is such a flexible transport. Rather
than trying to design one monolithic application than has both the
CRUD functionality and the smarts to be able to talk HTML to end
users, why not split it into two smaller and simpler applications?</p>

<p><img src="/assets/radar.png" alt="radar.png" /></p>

<p>Put the main application logic into a RESTful server. This is where
all the CRUD-style access to resources takes place.</p>

<p>Then, write a second proxy server. This is an HTTP filter, sitting
between dumb browsers and your core resources. When browser-based
users need to interact with your resources, they actually connect to
this proxy. It then talks REST to your main server, and interprets the
RESTful responses back into a form that’s useful on the browser. And
this filter doesn’t have to be a dumb presentation layer—there’s
nothing to say that it can’t handle additional functionality as
well. Things like menus, user preferences, and so on could all sit
here.</p>

<p>Where does this filter sit? That depends. Sometimes it makes sense to
have it running locally on the user’s own computer. In this case
you’re back in a situation like the one we looked at with the blogging
software. Sometimes it makes sense to have the proxy running on the
network. In this case you gain some interesting architectural
flexibility—there’s no rule that says you must colocate your REST and
presentation servers. Potentially this can lead to better response
times, lower network loads, and increased security.</p>

<p>With this approach, we can lose all the hacks we need to make to our
URLs and POST data to make them act RESTfully. And we can lose all the
ugly <code class="highlighter-rouge">respond_to</code> stanzas in our Rails server code. We might even be
able to get better reuse, sharing both resource servers and
presentation servers between applications.</p>

<p>Let’s call it <em>RADAR</em>. We have a RESTful Application talking to
Dumb-Ass Recipients.</p>

<p>Does it work? I don’t know. You tell me.</p>
