        <p>Just before the weekend, I did something stupid and hurtful, and I’d
like to make it right.</p>

<p>For the last few weeks, I’ve been getting e-mails about a book under
development over at O’Reilly called <em>Software Craftsmanship—from
Apprentice to Journeyman.</em> People kept pointing out that the main
title was the same as Pete McBreen’s book (for which I wrote the
foreword), and that the overall structure of the title was similar to
that of <em>The Pragmatic Programmer.</em></p>

<p>After a while, this started to get under my skin. I wasn’t so much
concerned about the “journeyman” bit, but the duplication of the title
just seemed wrong to me—I really liked Pete’s book, and I didn’t want
to see it getting eclipsed. I complained about this to a senior editor
at O’Reilly, and he said he’d bring it up with the book’s editor, who
worked for him. I heard nothing back.</p>

<p>So, at the end of a tiring week, I wrote a blog post, complaining
about the title.</p>

<p>That was wrong of me.</p>

<p>It was wrong for a number of reasons.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I could, and probably should, have bypassed etiquette and contacted
the authors directly, even though they write for a rival publisher.</li>
  <li>It really wasn’t any of my business.</li>
  <li>But, most importantly, it took something which was a kind of
intellectual annoyance and turned it into something that made the
authors of the book feel bad. And for that, I apologize.</li>
</ul>

<p>This year, I’ve been the target of some cruel blog posts. Most readers
of these posts viewed them as fine sport. But as the recipient of the
criticism, I’m here to tell you that it hurts. It doesn’t matter
whether it is based on truth or whether it isn’t. It doesn’t matter
whether the person writing them knows you or is a total stranger. It
hurts. Public attacks like this are virtually impossible to defend
against, and that is a cruel violation. It’s cruel when it is done to
you, and it’s cruel when you do it to others.</p>

<p>So, I of all people should have known better. I should have had the
common sense to realize that my comments, aimed at a book, were going
to be hurtful to the authors. It’s kind of obvious, really.</p>

<p>I wasn’t thinking straight, and I messed up.</p>

<p>So, Dave and Ade, I’m sorry for any distress I caused.</p>

<p>Good luck with your book.</p>
