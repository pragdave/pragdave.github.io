      <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>I’m a really big fan of Domain-Specific Languages. Andy and I plugged
them back in ‘98 when writing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1204863620&amp;sr=8-1">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>. I’ve written my share of them over the
years, and I’ve used even more. Which is why it is distressing to see
that a whole group of developers are writing DSLs (and discussing
DSLs) without seeming to get one of the fundamental principles behind
good DSL design.</p>

<h3 id="domain-experts-dont-speak-a-natural-language">Domain experts don’t speak a natural language</h3>

<p>Let’s say that another way. Whenever domain experts communicate, they
may seem to be speaking in English (or French, or whatever). But they
are not. They are speaking <em>jargon</em>, a specialized language that
they’ve invented as a shorthand for communicating effectively with
their peers. Jargon may use English words, but these words have been
warped into having very different meanings—meanings that you only
learn through experience in the field.</p>

<p>Let’s look at some successful domain specific languages before turning
our attention on the way that some DSLs are trying just a little too
hard.</p>

<h3 id="success-story-1-dependency-management-in-make">Success Story 1: Dependency Management in Make</h3>

<p>The Make utility has been a mainstay of Unix software development for
over 30 years. You can complain about some strange syntax rules (some
of which involve the invisible difference between tabs and spaces),
but it would be hard to argue that Make hasn’t had a major impact in
the open source world.</p>

<p>At its heart, Make addresses the building of systems from components
in the presence of dependencies. Make lets me express the dependencies
between header files, source files, object files, libraries, and
executable images. It also lets me specify the commands to execute to
resolve those dependencies when certain items are missing. For
example, I could say</p>

<div class="language-makefile highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nl">my_prog.o</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nf">my_prog_.c common.h</span>

<span class="nl">extras.o</span><span class="o">:</span>   <span class="nf">extras.c common.h</span>

<span class="nl">my_prog</span><span class="o">:</span>    <span class="nf">my_prog.o extras.o</span>
            <span class="err">cc</span> <span class="err">-o</span> <span class="err">my_prog</span> <span class="err">-lc</span> <span class="err">my_prog.o</span> <span class="err">extras.o</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This example of the Make DSL says that <code class="highlighter-rouge">my_prog.o</code> depends
on <code class="highlighter-rouge">my_prog.c</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">common.h</code>, and that<code class="highlighter-rouge">extras.o</code> depends
on <code class="highlighter-rouge">extras.c</code> and also depends on <code class="highlighter-rouge">common.h</code>. The final
program, <code class="highlighter-rouge">my_prog</code>, depends on the two object files. To build the
program, we have to execute the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cc</code> command on the line that follows
the dependency line. No build command is needed for the object files:
in this case Make knows what to do implicitly.</p>

<p>People who build software from source are domain experts in the area
of dependencies and build commands. They need concise ways of
expressing that expertise, of saying things like “if I ask you to
ensure my program is up-to-date, and the common header file has been
changed, then I want you to rebuild all the dependent object files
before then rebuilding the main program”. Make is by no means perfect,
but its longevity shows that it goes a long way as a DSL to meeting
its expert’s needs.</p>

<h3 id="success-story-2-active-record-declarations">Success Story 2: Active Record Declarations</h3>

<p>Love it or loathe it, you have to admit that Rails has changed the
game. And one reason is its extensive use of DSLs. For example, when
you are writing model classes, you are claiming to be an expert on
your application’s domain, and in the relationships between objects in
that domain. And Rails has a nifty DSL to let you express those
relationships.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Post</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
  <span class="n">has_many</span> <span class="ss">:comments</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">.</span><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="nf">end</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Comment</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
  <span class="n">belongs_to</span> <span class="ss">:post</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">.</span><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="nf">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The two lines containing <code class="highlighter-rouge">has_many</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">belongs_to</code> are part of a
data modeling DSL provided by Rails. Behind the scenes, this
simple-looking code creates a whole heap of supporting infrastructure
in the application, infrastructure that allows the programmer to
easily navigate and manage the relationships between (in this case)
posts and comments.</p>

<p>At first blush, this might seem like an English-language DSL. But,
despite appearances, <code class="highlighter-rouge">has_many</code> and<code class="highlighter-rouge">belongs_to</code> are not English
phrases. They are jargon from the world of modeling. They have a
specific meaning in that context, a meaning that is clear to
developers using Rails (because those developers take on the role of
domain modeler when they start writing the application).</p>

<h3 id="success-story-3-groovy-builders">Success Story 3: Groovy Builders</h3>

<p>The Groovy language has a wonderful way of expressing data in
code. The builder concept lets you construct a set of nodes as a side
effect of code execution. You can then express those nodes as (for
example) XML, or JSON, or Swing user interfaces. Here’s a trivial
example that constructs some nodes describing a person which we can
then output as XML.</p>

<div class="language-groovy highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">StringWriter</span>
<span class="n">xml</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">groovy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">xml</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">MarkupBuilder</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">result</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="n">xml</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">person</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nl">category:</span> <span class="s1">'employee'</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s1">'dave'</span><span class="o">)</span>
  <span class="n">likes</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s1">'programming'</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
<span class="n">println</span> <span class="n">result</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This would generate something like</p>

<div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;person</span> <span class="na">category=</span><span class="s">"employee"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;name&gt;</span>dave<span class="nt">&lt;/name&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;likes&gt;</span>programming<span class="nt">&lt;/likes&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/person&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>(Jim Wierich took this idea and created the wonderful Ruby Builder
library, the basis of Rails’ XML-generating templates.)</p>

<p>Again, we have a DSL aimed squaring at someone who knows what they are
doing. If you’re creating XML, then you know that the elements can be
nested, that they can have textual content, and that elements have
optional attributes. The Builder DSL takes care of all the details for
you—the angle brackets, any quoting, and so on—but you still have to
know the underlying concepts. Again, the language of the DSL is the
language of the domain.</p>

<h3 id="seduced-by-language">Seduced by Language</h3>

<p>Over the years, people have looked at DSLs and wondered just how far
they can be taken. Would it be possible to create a DSL that could be
used by somewhat who wasn’t a domain expert? So far, the answer is
“no.” The problem is that abstractions leak—to do things in a domain,
you need to know the domain. The folks who brought us Startrek TNG
pretended otherwise. Jean Luc Picard used an English language DSL to
talk to his food dispenser. It worked every time. But, in the real
world, you know that the first time someone said “Earl Gray, hot” to
this magic box, they’d be surprised when a naked English peer covered
in baby oil popped out.</p>

<p>The reality is that languages such as English, French, and so on, are
imprecise. That ambiguity makes them powerful. Because of this,
whenever we try to create a DSL that looks like a natural language, we
fall short. Take AppleScript as an example. On the face of it, it
looks nice and expressive—we’re writing something that looks very
natural. Here’s an example from the Apple example scripts.</p>

<div class="language-applescript highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">set</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">this_file</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">to</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">choose file</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">without</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">invisibles</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="k">try</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="k">tell</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">application</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Image Events"</span><span class="w">
      </span><span class="nb">launch</span><span class="w">
      </span><span class="k">set</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">this_image</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">to</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">open</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">this_file</span><span class="w">
      </span><span class="nv">scale</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">this_image</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">to</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">size</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">640</span><span class="w">
      </span><span class="nv">save</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">this_image</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">with</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">icon</span><span class="w">
      </span><span class="nb">close</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">this_image</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="k">end</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">tell</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="k">on</span> <span class="k">error</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">error_message</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nb">display dialog</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">error_message</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="k">end</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">try</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>
</div>

<p>Kind of makes sense, doesn’t it? I thought so too. So, for years, I’ve
been trying to get into AppleScript. I keep trying, and I keep
failing. Because the language is deceptive. They try to make it
English-like. But it isn’t English. It’s a programming language. And
it has rules and a syntax that are very unEnglish like. There’s a
major cognitive dissonance—I have to take ideas expressed in a natural
language (the problem), then map them into an artificial language (the
AppleScript programming model), but then write something that is a
kind of faux natural language. (Piers Cawley calls these kinds of
DSLs <a href="http://www.bofh.org.uk/articles/2007/08/08/domain-specific-pidgin">domain-specific pidgin</a>, but my understanding is that pidgins are full languages,
and our code hasn’t got that far.)</p>

<p>What’s the point? When you’re writing logic like this, with exception
handling, command sequencing, and (in more advanced examples)
conditionals and loops, then what you’re doing is <strong>programming</strong>. The
domain is the world of code. If you’re not up to programming, then you
shouldn’t be writing AppleScript. And if you are up to programming,
then AppleScript just gets in your way.</p>

<p>But this isn’t a discussion of AppleScript. That’s just an example of
the kind of trouble you get into when you forget what the domain is
and try to create natural language DSLs.</p>

<h3 id="testing-times">Testing Times</h3>

<p>Here’s a little code from a test written using the <a href="http://chneukirchen.org/blog/archive/2007/01/announcing-test-spec-0-3-a-bdd-interface-for-test-unit.html">test/spec</a> framework.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">specify</span> <span class="s2">"should be a string"</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="vi">@result</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">should</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">be</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">a</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">kind_of</span> <span class="no">String</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">specify</span> <span class="s2">"value should be 'cat'"</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="vi">@result</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">should</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">equal</span> <span class="s2">"cat"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It’s an elegant example of what can be done with Ruby. And, don’t get
me wrong. I’m not picking on Chris here. I think he’s created a clever
framework, and one that is likely to become quite popular.</p>

<p>But let’s look at it from a DSL point of view. What is the domain? I’m
thinking it is the specification of the correct behavior of
programs. And who are the domain experts? That’s a trickier question
to answer. In an ideal world, it would be the business users. But, the
reality is that if the business users had the time, patience, an
inclination to write things at this level, they wouldn’t need
programmers. Don’t kid yourselves—writing these specs
is <em>programming</em>, and the domain experts are programmers.</p>

<p>As a programmer, a couple of things leap out at me from these
tests. First, there’s the duplication. The<code class="highlighter-rouge">specify</code> lines are a form
of grouping, and each contains a string documenting what that group
tests. But the whole point of the DSL part of the exercise is to make
that blindingly obvious anyway. Now the BDD folks say that you write
the specifications first, without any content, and then gradually add
the tests in the blocks as you add supporting application code. I’d
suggest that you might want to look at ways of removing the eventual
duplication by transforming the specification into the test.</p>

<p>But for me the really worrying thing is the
syntax. <code class="highlighter-rouge">@result.should.be.a.kind.of String</code>. It reads like
English. But it isn’t. The words are separated by periods, except the
last two, where we have a space. As a programmer, I know why. But as a
user, I worry about it. In the first example, we
write<code class="highlighter-rouge">@result.should.be.a.kind_of</code>. Why not <code class="highlighter-rouge">kind.of</code>? If I want to
test that floats are roughly equal, I’d have
said <code class="highlighter-rouge">@result.should.be.close value</code>. Why not <code class="highlighter-rouge">close.to value</code>?</p>

<p>Trivial details, but it means that I can’t just write tests using my
knowledge of English—I have to look things up. ANd if I have to do
that, why not just use a language/API that is closers to the domain of
specifications and testing? Chris’s work is great, but it illustrates
how a DSL that pretends to be English can never really get there. The
domain of his language is software development—it would be perfectly
OK to produce a DSL that makes sense in that domain.</p>

<p><a href="">RSpec</a> is another behavior-driven testing
framework. Here’s part of a specification (or should it be test?).</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">describe</span> <span class="s2">"(empty)"</span> <span class="k">do</span>

<p>Another nice, readable piece of code, full of clever Ruby tricks. But,
again, the attempt to create a natural language feel in the DSL leads
to all sorts of leaks in the abstraction. Look at the use
of <code class="highlighter-rouge">should</code>. We have <code class="highlighter-rouge">should be_empty</code>. Here, the actual assertion is
(somewhat surprisingly) “should be_”. That’s right—the <code class="highlighter-rouge">be_</code> part is
really part of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">should</code>, indicating that what follows the
underscore is a predicate method to be called (after adding a question
mark, so we’d call <code class="highlighter-rouge">@result.empty?</code> in this case). Then we have
another way of using <em>should</em> in the
phrase <code class="highlighter-rouge">it_should_behave_like</code>—all one word. Then there’s a third way
of using <em>should</em> when we reach <code class="highlighter-rouge">should raise_error</code>. And, of course,
all these uses of <em>should</em> differ from the use in test/spec, even
though both strive for an English-like interface. The same kinds of
dissonance occur with the use of <code class="highlighter-rouge">it</code> in the first three lines (<code class="highlighter-rouge">it
{...}</code> vs.<code class="highlighter-rouge">it_should_...</code> vs. <code class="highlighter-rouge">it "..."</code>).</p>

<h3 id="its-a-domain-language">It’s a Domain Language</h3>

<p>Just to reiterate, I’m not bashing either of these testing frameworks—they are popular and I’m in favor of anything that brings folks to the practices of testing.</p>

<p>However, I am concerned that the popularity of these frameworks, and
other similar uses of English-as-a-DSL, may lead developers
astray. Martin Fowler writes about <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html">fluent interfaces</a>. I think his work might have been misunderstood—the
fluency here is programmer fluency, not English fluency. It’s writing
succinct, expressive code (and, in particular, using method chaining
where appropriate).</p>

<p>The language in a DSL should be the language of the domain, not the
natural language of the developer. Resist the temptation to use cute
tricks to make the DSL more like a natural, human language. By doing
so you might add to its readability, but I can guarantee that you’ll
be taking away from its writability, and you’ll be adding uncertainty
and ambiguity (the strengths of natural languages). The second you
find yourself writing</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">a</span>
  <span class="nb">self</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>so that you can use “a” as a connector in</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>add.a.diary.entry.for("Lunch").for(August.10.at(3.pm))
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>you know you’ve crossed a line. This is not longer a DSL. It’s broken
English.</p>
