      <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>Thirteen years ago, I was among seventeen middle-aged white guys who
gathered at Snowbird, Utah. We were there because we shared common beliefs about
developing software, and we wondered if there was a way to describe what
we believed.</p>

<p>It took less than a day to come up with a short list of values. We
published those values, along with a list of practices, as the
<a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/‎">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Individuals and Interactions</strong> over Processes and Tools<br />
<strong>Working Software</strong> over Comprehensive Documentation<br />
<strong>Customer Collaboration</strong> over Contract Negotiation, and<br />
<strong>Responding to Change</strong> over Following a Plan</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was proud of what we did, both the process we followed and the
result it produced. And I think that the existence of the  manifesto has helped
developers break free some some of the wasteful and soul-destroying
practices of the ’80s and ’90s.</p>

<p>However, since the Snowbird meeting, I haven’t participated in any
Agile events,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> I haven’t affiliated with the Agile Alliance,
and I haven’t done any “agile” consultancy. I didn’t attend the 10th
anniversary celebrations.</p>

<p>Why? Because I didn’t think that any of these things were in the
spirit of the manifesto we produced. Having conferences about agility
is not too far removed from having conferences about ballet dancing,
and forming an industry group around the four values always struck me
as creating a trade union for people who breathe.</p>

<p>And, unfortunately, I think time has proven me right. The word “agile”
has been subverted to the point where it is effectively meaningless,
and what passes for an agile community seems to be largely an arena
for consultants and vendors to hawk services and products.</p>

<p>So I think it is time to retire the word “Agile.”</p>

<p>I don’t think anyone could object to a ban on the word when it is used
as a noun. That’s just plain wrong. “Do Agile Right” and “Agile for
Dummies” are just two of the innumerable attacks on the English
language featuring the word. They are meaningless. <em>Agile</em> is
not a noun, it’s an adjective, and it must qualify something else. “Do
Agile Right” is like saying “Do Orange Right.”</p>

<p>But, beyond the grammar problem, there’s a bigger issue. Once the
Manifesto became popular, the word <em>agile</em> became a magnet for anyone
with points to espouse, hours to bill, or products to sell. It
became a marketing term, coopted to improve sales in
the same way that words such as <em>eco</em> and <em>natural</em> are. A word that
is abused in this way becomes useless—it stops having meaning as it
transitions into a brand.</p>

<p>This hurts everyone, but I’m particularly sensitive to the damage it
does to developers. It isn’t easy writing code, and developers
naturally are on the lookout for things that will help them deliver
value more effectively. I still firmly believe that sticking to the values
and practices of the manifesto will help them in this endeavor.</p>

<p>But once the word agile becomes meaningless, developers can no longer
use it as a guide to what is useful in their practice. We may as well
simply globally replace the word agile with whitespace.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="moving-to-the-right">Moving to the Right</h2>

<p>Let’s look again at the four values:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Individuals and Interactions</strong> over Processes and Tools<br />
<strong>Working Software</strong> over Comprehensive Documentation<br />
<strong>Customer Collaboration</strong> over Contract Negotiation, and<br />
<strong>Responding to Change</strong> over Following a Plan</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The phrases on the left represent an ideal—given the choice between
left and right, those who develop software with agility will favor the
left.</p>

<p>Now look at the consultants and vendors who say they’ll get you
started with “Agile.” Ask yourself where they are positioned on the
left-right axis. My guess is that you’ll find them process and tool
heavy, with many suggested work products (consultant-speak for
documents to keep managers happy) and considerably more planning than
the contents of a whiteboard and some sticky notes.</p>

<p>If you see this too, then it’s more evidence of the corruption and
devaluation of the word “agile.”</p>

<p>(Of course, some of these consultants may well have paid for a two-day
training course. I haven’t, so they are masters and I am not, which
means I’m probably wrong.)</p>

<h2 id="back-to-the-basics">Back to the Basics</h2>

<p>Here is how to do something in an agile fashion:</p>

<p>What to do:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Find out where you are</li>
    <li>Take a small step towards your goal</li>
    <li>Adjust your understanding based on what you learned</li>
    <li>Repeat</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>How to do it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When faced with two or more alternatives that deliver roughly the
same value, take the path that makes future change easier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that’s it. Those four lines and one practice encompass everything
there is to know about effective software development. Of course, this
involves a fair amount of thinking, and the basic loop is nested
fractally inside itself many times as you focus on everything from
variable naming to long-term delivery, but anyone who comes up with
something bigger or more complex is just trying to sell you something.</p>

<p>All of these sentences are imperative—they are based on verbs telling
us what to do and how to do it.</p>

<p>And that leads me to my suggestion.</p>

<p>Let’s abandon the word agile to the people who don’t do things.</p>

<p>Instead, let’s use a word that describes what we do.</p>

<h3 id="lets-develop-with-agility">Let’s develop with <em>agility</em></h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You aren’t an agile programmer—you’re a programmer who programs with agility.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You don’t work on an agile team—your team exhibits agility.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You don’t use agile tools—you use tools that enhance your agility.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It’s easy to tack the word “agile” onto just about anything. Agility
is harder to misappropriate.</p>

<p>And that’s important—you can buy and sell labels. Attend a short
course, and suddenly you can add a label to your job title. But you
can’t buy experience—you can only earn it.</p>

<h3 id="and-lets-protect-our-investment">And let’s protect our investment</h3>

<p>Ultimately, what we do trumps what we call it. But good words help us
communicate effectively.</p>

<p>We’ve lost the word agile. Let’s try to hang on to agility. Let’s keep
it meaningful, and let’s protect it from those who would take the soul
of our ideas in order to sell it back to us.</p>

      <p>I started thinking about this blog post while I was visiting Agile India 2014, my one and only conference on agility. I went to that not because of the topic, but because of my respect for the organizer, <a href="http://nareshjain.com/">Naresh Jain</a>.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>And, yes, I’ve fallen into the trap myself. When Ruby on Rails came along, I was impressed with the agility it gave me when working on web projects, so I called the book I wrote “Agile Web Development with Rails.” If I was writing that book today, the title would be different.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
