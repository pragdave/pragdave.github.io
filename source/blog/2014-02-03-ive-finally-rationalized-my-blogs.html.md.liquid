I've been blogging for just over 10 years.

Early on, I used by own software, RubLog. It let me write posts in
Textile. When I checked them into a repository, they automatically got
converted to HTML and were posted as static content on my blog site.

I got tired of managing the self-hosting, and moved to a "proper"
blogging service. After a while, I moved to another. At the end of
last year, I moved to a third. I then discovered that their supposed
change to allow searching of articles wasn't quite true, and so had to
abandon them.

I've moved back to somewhere I feel comfortable. I'm now using
[Octopress](http://octopress.org). It lets me create blog entries
using Markdown, and I check them into a repository. It serves the
content as static pages, and it gives me the ability to write plugins
to remove the duplication associated with creating consistent
formatting of various chunks of content.

It took a little while (read: all of Sunday) to work out how to get
two blogs working on a single Github account, but they are working
now.

So, for the forseeable future, my main blog will live at
[pragdave.me](http://pragdave.me), and CodeKata will be at
[codekata.com](http://codekata.com).

The good news is that I've finally recovered all the assets that had
become disbursed or lost over the last 10 years (including the
mythical Kata Fifteen). The bad news is that permalinks created in the
past turn out to be not so permanent (sorry).

Anyway, now I can stop worrying about the blog, and start worrying
about the content.
