Almost 10 years ago, Ze Frank gave a Ted talk that contained a
[reading of 419 scam email](http://www.ted.com/talks/ze_frank_s_nerdcore_comedy?language=en#t-102430).

I've been getting a couple of "let us write for you" emails a day.
Most are just a little sad. But, when you consider that they are
actually asking to add content to my site, I think the following
deserves a special mention. Try reading it aloud. With feeling.

> Hi Mr. Thomas,
