Every good relationship starts by establishing some basic ground
rules. Here’s ours: you’re on your own. Totally, bleakly, and emptily
on your own. No support. No requests for enhancements. No cards on
your birthday. And I want to continue to see other developers.


But I will consider patches. In particular splitting it up so it can
be installed as a Gem would be really nice. You’d probably need some
kind of generator to create a new slide show. I’d guess would contain
just a Rakefile, a slides/ directory and an html/ directory.


Enjoy.
