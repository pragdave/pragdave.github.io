### For Thee

{%dtaudio for_thee%}

A while back, I was asked during an interview what I’d do if I had
three months off. I said I’d take piano lessons.

Well, my wife read that and very sweetly got me some. And then reality
hit home. I really do have totally uncoordinated hands. I try to play,
but I’m getting nowhere.

At the same time, I still enjoy noodling around with music. So my
piano teacher (in a move motivated by self-preservation, no doubt)
suggested we should look at composition instead. And I’ve been having
a whole bunch of fun ever since.

But then Chad Fowler reminds me that the test is having it heard,
which is kind of scary. But here’s my first piece. Be gentle…

(Update: people asked for the transcription: it’s <a

href="http://pragdave.blogs.pragprog.com/pragdave/files/for_thee.pdf">.</a> Some
of the pedal marks are screwy: I’m using Encore, and it seems to move
them around every time I save. I might well end up going back to
Sibelius. Forgive any amateur mistakes.)
