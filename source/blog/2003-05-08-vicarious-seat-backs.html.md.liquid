After a hellacious trip across to Norway for rOOts (note to self:
never fly Lufthansa transatlantic), the return came as a pleasant
relief. Not only was the SAS flight half-empty, letting me claim an
entire center row to myself, but their new A340 had something I hadn’t
seen before: nose and belly cameras wired into the seat-back video
displays.


A couple of touch screen menu picks, and I had one seat-back looking
forward, one looking down, and a third on the moving map. It says
something about the state of mind that you get in to on long flights
that I started playing a game, trying to tie moving map features up
with the downward-pointing camera. It turned out to be easy (which I
guess is what you’d expect): just as the moving map said we were over
the coast of Iceland, a rocky shoreline scrolled beneath us. Coming
across Canada approaching the Great Lakes, most of the larger rivers
on the map seemed to tie in with what I was seeing below. Looking out
the front and seeing the runway appear through the murk during our
final in to O’Hare was a nice way to end the trip. +1 SAS.
