<a href="http://www.railsconf.org/">RailsConf</a> in Chicago (June
22-25) promises to be an exciting affair. And it looks as if there’ll
be a number of people coming who are fairly new to Rails.


So Mike and Nicole Clark and I were sitting down after a day of
teaching a <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/">Rails Studio</a>, and
we came up with an idea. We’ll be running a one-day course before the
conference. It is designed to bring newcomers to Rails up to speed,
both with the framework and with Ruby.


We’re calling it the Rails <a
href="http://railsconf.org/pages/guidebook">Guidebook</a>. Think of it
as the difference between between turning up somewhere exotic knowing
nothing about the language, customs, and places to visit, and turning
up having spent a small amount of time reading a guide
book. Hopefully, a day spent with us will make the rest of the
conference more enjoyable (and informative).


We’re not charging for the Guidebook—it’s our way of saying “thank
you” to the community. Instead, we’re asking folks to donate to
charity before they come. Space is limited, so you might want to book
early. (And, the top 3 contributors will get some perks…)
