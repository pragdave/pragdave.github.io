If I’ve been distracted recently, it’s because Andy and I’ve been
heads-down getting our third book finalized. When we first started <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter_kit/utc/index.html">Pragmatic
Unit Testing in C# with NUnit</a>, we though it would be a fairly
light rework of the JUnit book. We were wrong. Instead, we’ve found
that we’ve rewritten entire chapters, and heavily modified much of the
rest.


The good news is that with this book we’re absolutely at the leading
edge. We were tracking the NUnit team as they added whole new sets of
features (check out _categories_ as a great way of grouping tests),
and Andy’s been working closely with Charlie Poole (thanks, Charlie!)
to make sure we’ve been capturing the spirit of what they’re
releasing.


We’ve also decided to try an experiment: this time we’re releasing the
PDF version while the paper book is going into production. Folks who
buy the PDF now will be able to get the standard combo discount
($12.50) on the paper book when it arrives from the printers.
