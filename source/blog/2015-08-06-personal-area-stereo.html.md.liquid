# Hyperlocal Music on the Cheap

I like listening to music while working. But I don't like wearing
headphones—after a while they start feeling claustrophobic.

After a little experimentation, I've come up with something that works
well for me. I have music that sounds almost as immersive as using
headphones, but at the same time is local to the chair where I work.

The setup uses a pair of Micca COVO-S bookshelf speakers (currently
about $40 on
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Micca-COVO-S-Compact-Bookshelf-Speakers/dp/B00N8265I8)).
I made stands for these using a couple of 5lb barbell weights from a
sporting goods store, two pieces of threaded iron conduit, and four pipe
flanges. I bolted the bottom flange to the weight, and used screws to attach the top
flange into the speaker base, separating it from the flange using
grommets. (I did this to isolate them a little—I have no idea if it is
necessary). The speaker wire runs up through the pipe.

Here's what they look like:

I use a Topping TP-30 class T Amplifier/USB DAC combination (about
$60-70), and a Sony SA-W2500 subwoofer (about $100).

The two Micca speakers are placed next to my chair, facing inwards. The
subwoofer and amp sit next to it. I plug my MacBook into the amp using USB
or via a cheap bluetooth audio receiver.

The chair-of-work looks like this:

The result sounds surprisingly good. The little Miccas have good
detail and fairly flat response from the low-mids up. The subwoofer
fills in the rest.

And the good thing for my family is that the sound is surprisingly
localized. Sitting it the chair, I get an immersive experience. But
get up to fetch a cup of tea, and the sound is just a mild background.
