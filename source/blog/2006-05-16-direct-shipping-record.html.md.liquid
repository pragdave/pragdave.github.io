I really like that fact that Andy and I still ship direct orders
in-house: we’re not currently using a fulfillment service. It means we
can take that little bit of personal care with the packing, and we can
correct minor order problems on-the-fly. We also get to see first-hand
just what is going on. We see a surprising number of orders for
multiple books, and it’s fun to track which books tend to sell with
others. We also get the occasional surprise, like the order in the
picture for 12 titles. Even more surprising is the fact that it was
from Australia.
