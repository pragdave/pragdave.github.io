I spoke with Jim Coplien at QCon Long, 2007. We chatted about <a
href="http://www.infoq.com/interviews/dave-thomas-agile-passion">Passion, Skill, and 'Having A Blast'</a>, touching on 
agilility in publishing; how to
turn what you love doing into a book; programming (and methodology)
monocultures; staying limber with code “katas”; and advice for
academics—help your students live with the passion of a 5-year old!
