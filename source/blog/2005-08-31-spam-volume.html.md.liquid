I’m sure I’m just in the minor leagues here, but for the last month or
so I’ve been averaging 50Mb of incoming spam a day. All but a handful
of messages die before reaching my inbox, but it makes me wonder. I’m
lucky enough to have fiber to the house, with some pretty decent
bandwidth both up and down. But two months ago I was on DSL, and only
a few years ago I was on ISDN, with dial-up before that. As the
connection speed increased, so did the volume of junk that found its
way down the pipe.


Maybe we’re seeing a kind of Parkinson’s Law in action here: trash
expands to fit the bandwidth available to it.
