Bob Payne recently <a
href="http://agiletoolkit.libsyn.com/rails_edge_2007_dave_thomas_monoculture_music_and_erlang_oh_my">interviewed me</a> at the Reston No Fluff Just Stuff show. We chatted about
agility, the Dreyfus model, Java, Ruby, Rails, and functional
languages, all against the gentle backdrop of the hotel’s Muzak (so at
least you can tell there are no edits…).
