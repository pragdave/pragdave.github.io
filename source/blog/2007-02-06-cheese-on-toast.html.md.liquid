I love good cheese on toast. The trick is to get a nice, thin, lightly
burned top while keeping the bulk of the cheese good and gooey. The
skin gives it taste, the goop texture and follow through.


Tonight I saw a trailer for a cooking show where the chef caramelized
the top of a creme brulée with a blowtorch. I couldn’t resist.


Lightly toast some bread. Add a really, really thin spread of
marmalade (optional, but try it…). Top with grated cheese and apply
the MAPP torch. You’d be surprised just how close you have to hold it
to get the cheese to brown—I started waving it vaguely in the
direction of the bread, but ended up playing the flame directly over
it.


The result was gorgeous.
