<a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails">Agile Web
Development with Rails</a> has been finalized. We worked hard with our
printers, Malloy, to come up with what is possibly the most agile book
publishing schedule ever. As a result, the final PDF went in for
printing today (with 47 pages changed since I first sent them the book
a week or so ago), and the books will be bound and boxed on
July 28. They then enter the distribution phase, so it’ll still be a
week or so before they start shipping, but it looks as if we’ll have
some for OSCON.




Some stats:

* The PML source for the book is about 145k words, and the files weigh in at 1.3Mb.
* There are 1041 Ruby and rhtml source code files used as examples in
  the book (about 560kb).
* The book went through roughly 2000 Subversion commits since
  inception.
* Reviewers generated well in excess of 6Mb of comments.
* We’ve had four released versions of the beta book, and now one final
  version.
* Beta readers made over 780 suggestions, comments, and typo reports,
  most of which made their way into the printed book.
* To date the book has been bought by people in **sixty
  three** countries (that blows me away).

Thank you again to everyone who trusted the process and participated
in the Beta program. You can update to the final version of the PDF at
the regular URL (I’ll be sending an e-mail around to you all sometime
today with the link).


And for everyone else—the folks waiting for the dust to settle before
exploring the book—now’s a great time to come on board. Welcome!
