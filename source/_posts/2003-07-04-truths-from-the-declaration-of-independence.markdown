Experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while
evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms
to which they are accustomed.

On the Fourth of July, I went over to the <a
href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibit_hall/charters_of_freedom/declaration/declaration_transcription.html">archives</a> to
read a transcription of the Declaration of Independence. In a way it
seems cheap to draw project-team lessons from such a document, but
there is a wonderful quote in the middle that I hadn’t noticed before:

Are we currently putting up with things “to which we have become
accustomed” rather than fighting to right them?
