I’d like to be able to express my unit tests fairly naturally, using
the conditional operators built into the language. So, for example,
I’d want to write:

``` ruby
expect(factorial(5)) == 120
expect(factorial(10)) > 10000
```

I’d like the error messages to show both the code that caused the
error _and_ the values that caused the error. So, for example, I’d
want the following (incorrect) test

``` ruby
expect(factorial(6)) == 600
```
to output something like

```
/Users/dave/tmp/tmc/blog_tests.rb:16
    the code was: expect(factorial(6)) == 600,
    but 720 != 600
```

and

``` ruby
expect(1) > 2
```

should say

```
/Users/dave/Play/tmc/blog_tests.rb:11
    the code was: expect(1) > 2,
    but 1 <= 2
```

(Note how the expression showing the actual values negates the
comparison operator to make it easier to read.)


I annotate my code with comments, so I’d like to be able to annotate
my tests the same way.


```
expect(factorial(6)) == 600  # Deliberate bad test
```

should produce something like

```
/Users/dave/tmp/tmc/blog_tests.rb:17
     **Deliberate bad test**
     the code was: expect(factorial(6)) == 600,
     but 720 != 600  
```

Sometimes I write longer comments.

```
# The factorial of 6 is a special case,
# because of the labor laws in Las Vegas
expect(factorial(6)) == 600
   
```

So the resulting errors are longer, too.

```
/Users/dave/Play/tmc/blog_tests.rb:21
    **The factorial of 6 is a special case, because of the labor laws in Las Vegas**
    the code was: expect(factorial(6)) == 600,
    but 720 != 600
```

I like to be able to group my tests.

``` ruby
testing("positive factorials") do
  expect(factorial(1)) == 1
  expect(factorial(2)) == 2
  expect(factorial(5)) == 120
end

testing("factorial of zero") do
  expect(factorial(0)) == 1
end

testing("negative factorials") do
  expect(factorial(-1)) == 1
  expect(factorial(-5)) == 1
end
```

I like the description of the group to appear along with any
individual test annotation if a test fails.

``` ruby
testing("factorial of zero") do
  # this test is deliberately wrong
  expect(factorial(0)) == 0
end
```
will produce

```
/Users/dave/Play/tmc/blog_tests.rb:31--while testing factorial of zero
    this test is deliberately wrong
    the code was: expect(factorial(0)) == 0,
    but 1 != 0
    
```

I like to have the flexibility to set up the environment for a group
of tests. I also like to have the idea of a global environment which
doesn’t get messed up by the running of tests (so that subsequent
tests can run in that environment. I don’t see why I should have to
package things into methods with magic names to have that
happen. Instead, why not just have transactional instance variables?
That way, I can use regular methods to set up the state for a test.

```
@order = Order.new("Dave Thomas", "Ruby Book")

testing("normal case") do
  expect(@order.valid?) == true
end

testing("missing name in order") do
  @order.name = nil
  expect(@order.valid?) == false
  expect(@order.error)  == "missing name"
end

# Check that order is reset to valid state here
expect(@order.valid?) == true
```

So, in the preceding case, the second `testing` block changed
the `@order` object. However, once the block terminated, the object
was restored to its initial (valid) state.

So, while waiting for the last day of the Rails Studio to start, I
hacked together a quick proof of concept. It’s less than 100 lines of
code. All the output shown here was generated by it. Is this worth
developing into something usable?
