One of the emerging benefits of attending a <a
href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/">Rails Studio</a> is membership in
the Studio mailing list. The posts in that list are consistently on
target.


A few weeks back, <a href="http://dovetailcomputing.com/blog/">Eric
Knapp</a> posted a long message which I feel nicely sums up the
difference Rails makes. It isn’t an issue of Rails being substantially
different to the alternatives. It’s more that the lowered barriers to
entry enable a broader base of people to benefit.


Anyway, with Eric’s permission, here’s the body of his post. It was titled

### Rails is more than I thought

_This past Friday I had a meeting with a client who is the director of
educational research and IT at a medium sized public school
district. I’m sure that you are all aware that school districts are
under intense pressure to cut their budgets and expenses. My client
can no longer replace any IT employee when someone leaves. They are
down to one network administrator (!) and two programmers. Their
programmers are just maintaining an old legacy system and really don’t
do any new development anymore. New development is done by student
interns from my Java program at my college. My students really
struggle with all kinds of limits that are set by the district’s
policies, procedures, and equipment._


_My client has also been struggling with how to move to the future. He
is under lots of pressure to cut even more deeply. There are those
within the district who want to end all development of new things and
only use off-the-shelf applications, as-is, with no customization._


_My client is not an IT person and he knows nothing about
programming. But, he is a very smart man and is very perceptive. My
meeting started with an overview of his current development efforts
with my students. Then I started sharing rails with him. I like rails
and I tend to be enthusiastic. About ten minutes into my presentation
he interrupted me and said, “So, this could save my IT department,
couldn’t it?”_


_I was really taken off guard by this! I simply answered, “Yes.” He
took over our meeting and started talking about all the things that he
and his people would like to do, but just can’t afford. He talked
about all the ideas that are shared with him by his staff and teachers
that also are just too expensive. My interns have started to help him
and we have worked very hard at trying to bring Java to his
department. But, they are just too slow, everything takes too long to
be viable anymore. I believe that we are now going to give up on
Java._


_We now have scheduled a kick-off meeting for maybe bringing Ruby on
Rails to this school district. Later he told me that this has given
him a little bit of hope. I might be able to have good geek fun while
helping children at the same time._


_This is exciting stuff! Rails appears to have reached some sort of
critical mass of productivity where ideas that live in the hearts and
minds of most people have a chance of getting out and onto the
screen. I’m starting to ask students and friends what those ideas
are. I am getting really interesting answers._


_I hope I’m not making too much of this, there is still lots of work
to be done and we will have to get grants to do it. But, there are
possibilities now where there weren’t any. There is a little bit of
hope. Sounds good to me. Many thanks to the rails community and to
this group for helping me get to this point._
