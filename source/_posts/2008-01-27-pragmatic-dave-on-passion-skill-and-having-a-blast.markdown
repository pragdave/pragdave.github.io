At QconLondon 2007 Jim Coplien spoke with “Pragmatic” Dave Thomas for InfoQ. This energetic 30-minute interview runs the gamut of Dave’s wide-ranging interests: ‘agile’ publishing; how to turn what you love doing into a book; programming (and methodology) monocultures; staying limber with code “katas”; and advice for academics: help your students live with the passion of a 5-year old!
