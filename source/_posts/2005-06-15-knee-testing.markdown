I still occasionally bump into folks who claim that all testing can
(and should) be automated. For those optimistic souls, I offer <a
href="http://www.kohl.ca/blog/archives/000104.html">this tale</a>, by
way of <a href="http://www.testing.com/cgi-bin/blog">Brian Marick’s
blog</a>.


Automated tests are necessary, and automated unit tests in particular
are a wonderful design aid. But ultimately they only test the things
you know to test. It’s the other things that get your knees wobbling
(you’ll have to read the story).
