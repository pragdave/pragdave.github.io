I few weeks back, Michael Swaine emailed asking for our impressions of
the computer book publishing situation. He also checked in with some
other publishers. His conclusions are posted in a new online <a

Dobbs</a> article.


I know that traditional publishing will never die—people just like
holding paper books too much. But the reality of the new world will
continue to drive publishers to find new ways of getting information
out there. That’s why our business is successful. We started by
applying software development project techniques to book creation
(version control, DRY, testing, etc). That gave us the lowest cost
model of any publisher I know, which in turn let us accept proposals
because we _wanted to see the book published_, and not because some
marketing model told us it would sell. We tried other innovations,
such as applying agile principles to publishing, gaining early and
continuous feedback with our <a
href="http://pragprog.com/frequently-asked-questions/beta-books">beta
book</a> program. And we’ll continue to innovate in the production of
books—I still get too much of a thrill from holding the
“fresh-from-the-printer smelling first copy of one of our paper books
not to.


But, underneath it all, we’re not really book publishers. What drives
us is helping the community we know: software developers. The initial
starter kit series was simply a way of spreading the information that
we gave to teams during our consulting gigs to a wider audience. The
Ruby and the Rails books were just a way of sharing a passion. The <a
href="http://pragprog.com/titles/jaerlang">Erlang</a> book, and books
such as <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/mnee">Release
It!</a> and <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/jsaccess">Design
Accessible Web Sites</a> highlight technologies and techniques that we
think are cool, and that we think will help other developers. We
choose to get that information out in book form because we feel that
the process of creating a book helps distill and refine the
information. It lets us add value as editors.


I think the problems of the publishing industry will turn out to be a
good thing. People get complacent during good times. When when times
get harder, the folks who survive are the ones who focus in on the
core of what they’re doing. All the publishers still in the field are
experimenting and innovating as they refine their focus.


Our focus is a passion for software development and a desire to help software developers have more fun while doing one of the most challenging jobs there is. I’m having a blast.
