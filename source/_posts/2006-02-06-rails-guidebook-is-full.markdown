I’m blown away!

The Rails <a
href="http://railsconf.org/pages/guidebook">Guidebook</a>, our day of
pre-conference training before <a
href="http://www.railsconf.org/">RailsConf</a>, is now officially
full. Chad Fowler and Jay Zimmerman, who are handling logistics, twice
negotiated to get bigger rooms, but we’ve had to draw the line at 150.

Yes, 150!

One hundred and fifty people are coming to learn about Rails, and have
agreed to donate at least $40 to charity. Many folks have already
donated a lot more. (And, remember, the three biggest donations get
some VIP treatment.) I’m so, so proud of our community for making this
happen. Ruby folks have always been nice to be around. To see them
contributing back to the outside world like this just confirms it.

Thank you all.

(If you are coming, remember to get your donation in, and bring your
receipt. See you there.)
