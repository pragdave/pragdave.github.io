For the next 2 weeks, here’s my vacation message:

{%blockquote%}
Subject: I’m on vacation, and I’ve deleted your message—really

I know this sounds brutal, but here’s the deal.

I can’t remember the last time I took a vacation where I
didn’t actually end up working a few hours each day handling e-mail. I
felt I had to, because if I didn’t, the Inbox would just grow and
grow, waiting for me when I got back—the idea that I’d be flying home
to 5,000 messages would always be nagging at me, detracting from
my holiday. So I worked (which also detracted from the holiday).

This time, I’m taking a different approach. I’m asking for your
help to make my break more enjoyable.

I’m going to be discarding email I receive. That’s right—your
email will be recycled into warm, fluffy bit-jackets for
underprivileged children. I won’t see it.

If it’s something you think I really, really need to know, you
can bypass this brutality by putting “urgent” in the subject
line. But before you do: if it is something that can be handled by the wonderful
Pragprog support folk, could you send your message to <a
href="mailto:support@pragprog.com">support@pragprog.com</a> if it can
wait until I get back on April 25, please resend your message then.

It’s an experiment. Bon voyage à moi!
