I've been writing software for over 40 years, and it's still the thing
I love doing. I've written microcode for IBM mainframes, operating
systems for PDP minis, a COBOL runtime, fault-tolerant communications
switches, checkout software for the Giotto spacecraft, viewdata
systems, embedded controllers, â€¦. I've worked in the financial,
aerospace, travel, oil, and communication industries.

I created all the book production, backend, and web code for
[pragprog.com](https://pragprog.com) (one of the first and largest Rails applications).
