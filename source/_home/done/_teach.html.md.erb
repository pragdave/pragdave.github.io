_The Pragmatic Programmer_ (cowritten with Andy Hunt) has sold
hundreds of thousands of copies, and regularly appears in developer's
top-ten lists (which is pretty humbling).

_Programming Ruby_ (now in its 4th edition)
introduced the world to the Ruby language.  _Agile Web Development
with Rails_ kicked off the Rails revolution.

My latest, _Programming Elixir 1.2_ looks like it could help ignite
a new functional and distributed programming movement.

I'm one of the seventeen authors of the
[_Manifesto for Agile Software Development_](http://agilemanifesto.org).
