No, I’m not stuttering. This evening, at the Software Development Jolt
Awards at SD West in Santa Clara, <a
href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html">Agile
Web Development with Rails</a> received the Jolt Award for best
technical book, and <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails
1.0</a> won the Jolt for best web development tools.

I have to say, when I saw that both the book and the framework were up
for awards, I was nervous, thinking that the judges might not want to
vote for Rails in two separate categories. The fact that they did says
a lot for the way Rails is now a mainstream player in the enterprise
software world. It’s clear the tipping point is behind us now, and
we’re a player.


Congratulations to DHH on his Jolt. And congratulations to the
Pragmatic Bookshelf: this is our <a
href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi/Random/JoltAward.rdoc">second
Jolt Award</a> in three years.


And, mostly, thanks to the Ruby community for providing the
environment in which all this can happen. I’m really proud of us all.
