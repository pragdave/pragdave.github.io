Laptops need power. Fuel cells generate power. Fuel cells burn organic
fuels. Many developers have excess body mass. Seems like a perfect
fit…


Sometimes ideas come together so naturally, and in such a balanced
way, that it’s clear that they were just meant to work
together. Apparently unrelated concepts and problems fuse into a
single tidy solution so perfect that, when looked at in hindsight, the
only possible reaction is “well, of course, it’s obvious.” Two
problems that share a single solution: a _fusing technology_. The
technology that solves one of your problems serendipitously solves the
other (apparently unrelated) issue.


Take the problems of developer health and laptop battery power.


**Problem One**: Spending all day, every day, in front of a keyboard
is clearly bad for your health. Developers are typically not the
most active of folk, and many have gained a number of extra pounds
while cranking out code on a diet of pizza and cola.


**Problem Two**: Laptops need power, and the meatier the laptop, the
more power it draws. Sit on a long flight, hacking Lisp into Emacs
while a DVD plays in a Window, and you’ll know the frustration. The
machine dies just as the last reel starts, and just as you finally
work out the quoting rules for your latest monster macro.


The **Fusing Technology**: Fuel Cells.


Laptop manufacturers are starting to roll out models powered by <a

cells.</a> Small catalytic reactors, powered by some kind of alcohol,
convert chemical energy into electrical power. Low-grade combustion
drives your laptop.


The current generation of fuel cell batteries use methanol: it’s a
fairly high-grade source of power. But they could also be driven off
lower-grade organic fuels: it just needs to be able to burn.


So here’s the synergy—the LipoBattery. Developers have excess fat:
they should use it to feed the fuel cells in their laptops. When you
sit down to code on a long plane trip, plumb a thin tube into an area
of unwanted adipose tissue, and let the battery suck power from you
while you lose weight. For home-based developers, special chairs could
have small needles built into the seat: just sit down and your
computer bursts into life. The longer you code, the more weight you
lose. It’s a perfect feedback loop. It’s synergy.


Or is that thinergy?
