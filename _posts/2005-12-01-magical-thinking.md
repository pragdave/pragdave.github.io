I’m reading Augusten Burroughs’ wonderful “Magical Thinking” on the
plane to Boston. It opens with a definition:

Magical Thinking
: A schizotypal personality disorder attributing to ones own actions
  something that has nothing to do with him or her and thus assuming
  that one has greater influence than is actually the case

I couldn’t help but mutate it slightly:

Project Planning
: A schizotypal personality disorder attributing to ones own actions
  something that has nothing to do with him or her and thus assuming
  that one has greater influence than is actually the case
