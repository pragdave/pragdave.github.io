We know that Elixir programming is about transforming state, and `|>`
operator plays the starring role in making that happen. But sometimes
you can't just chain two named functions togetherâ€”the output of one
doesn't match the first parameter of the next. Until I discovered this
trick, I had to break the pipeline and assert the interim result to a
local variable, or write a private function that massaged the value
into the right format.

This video shows you some ways of overcoming this.
It's probably not new, but I haven't seen the technique in code that
I've read.
