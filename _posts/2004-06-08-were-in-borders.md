I just checked some local bookstores—the Pragmatic Starter kit books
are now available in some Borders! That’s pretty neat: in a way the
loop is now closed. If you’ve been waiting to thumb through a book
before buying, now’s your chance.


So, next time you’re in a Borders, check to see if we’re there. (And
next time you’re in Barnes and Noble, ask ‘em why they take so long to
place orders :)
