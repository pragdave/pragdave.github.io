For the next 2 weeks, here’s my vacation message:

> Subject: I’m on vacation, and I’ve deleted your message—really
>
> I know this sounds brutal, but here’s the deal.
>
> I can’t remember the last time I took a vacation where I
> didn’t actually end up working a few hours each day handling e-mail. I
> felt I had to, because if I didn’t, the Inbox would just grow and
> grow, waiting for me when I got back—the idea that I’d be flying home
> to 5,000 messages would always be nagging at me, detracting from
> my holiday. So I worked (which also detracted from the holiday).
>
> This time, I’m taking a different approach. I’m asking for your
> help to make my break more enjoyable.
>
> I’m going to be discarding email I receive. That’s right—your
> email will be recycled into warm, fluffy bit-jackets for
> underprivileged children. I won’t see it.
>
> If it’s something you think I really, really need to know, you
> can bypass this brutality by putting “urgent” in the subject line.
> But before you do: if it is something that can be handled by the
> wonderful Pragprog support folk, could you send your message
> to support@pragprog.com. If it can wait until I get back on April 25,
> please resend your message then.
>
> It’s an experiment. Bon voyage à moi!
