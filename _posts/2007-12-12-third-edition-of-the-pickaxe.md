Ruby 1.9 is just around the corner, so it looks like a good time to create a new edition of Programming Ruby. So, I’m pleased to announce that the Third Edition of the PickAxe has just entered beta.


The book’s home page is at
[pragprog.com/titles/ruby3](https://pragprog.com/titles/ruby3).


Although 1.9 is largely compatible with 1.8, there are definite
differences. And it’s been an interesting ride getting the examples in
the book to compile and run with the current 1.9 interpreter. The book
pushes the envelope in many different areas, and includes example code
designed to illustrate edge cases. When I find these, I’m flagging
them in the text and (if they look like bugs) adding them to the
tracking system. But, so far, 1.9 is looking like a big win for Ruby.


Nice job, everyone.
