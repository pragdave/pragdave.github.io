On the Fourth of July, I went over to the <a
href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibit_hall/charters_of_freedom/declaration/declaration_transcription.html">archives</a> to
read a transcription of the Declaration of Independence. In a way it
seems cheap to draw project-team lessons from such a document, but
there is a wonderful quote in the middle that I hadn’t noticed before:

> Experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while
> evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms
> to which they are accustomed.


Are we currently putting up with things “to which we have become
accustomed” rather than fighting to right them?
