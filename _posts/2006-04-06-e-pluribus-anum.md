Went to a school production of _The Wizard of Oz_ last night. Good
fun. However, the Wizard had a slight hiccup. The line is supposed to
go

> Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
> Universitartus Committiartum E Pluribus Unum, I hereby confer upon you
> the honorary degree of ThD.

Unfortunately, it came out _E Pluribus Anum_.

Which may well be the official motto for the wisdom of crowds…
