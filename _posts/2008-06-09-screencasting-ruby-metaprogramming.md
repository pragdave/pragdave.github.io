I’ve been teaching Ruby (and in particularly, metaprogramming Ruby)
for almost 7 years now. And, in that time, I’ve gradually found ways
of cutting through all the confusing stuff to the actual
essentials. And when you do that, suddenly things get a lot
simpler. I’ve always know that Ruby didn’t really have class methods
and singleton methods, for example, but until recently I didn’t have a
simple way to explain that.


Then, when preparing to give an <a
href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/ruby">Advanced Ruby Studio</a>, my
thinking crystalized. Metaprogramming in Ruby becomes simple to
explain if you focus on four things:

Objects, not classes.  There is only one kind of method call in
Ruby. The “right-then-up” rule covers everything.  Understanding
that `self` can only be changed by a method call with a receiver or by
a class or module definition makes it easy to keep track of what’s
going on when metaprogramming.  Knowing that Ruby keeps an internal
concept of “the current class” which is where `def` defines its
methods. Knowing what changes this makes it easier to know what’s
going on.

I tried this approach in a number of Studios, and refined it during
some talks for RubyFools in Copenhagen and Oslo.


So Mike Clark, who’s producing our new series of <a
href="http://pragmatic.tv/">screencasts</a>, started pushing me to put
this description into video. Last week I finally cleared the decks
enough to record the <a
href="http://pragprog.com/screencasts/v-dtrubyom/the-ruby-object-model-and-metaprogramming">first three episodes</a>.

First, I have to say it was a blast. I’d never recorded this many
minutes of screencast before, and I was blown away by the amount of
time it takes. I was also surprised at the level of detail involved,
from microphone setup (which I messed up for a couple of segments) to
color matching between codecs, it was fun to learn a whole new set of
technologies.


I was also surprised at how hard it was to talk to a microphone. When
we write books, we always try to write as if the reader was sitting
there next to us. I tried to to the same approach with the
screencasts, but it takes a whole new set of skills…


What I really liked was the way that I could live code examples to
illustrate points. The first episode has maybe 50/50 code and
exposition, and the second and third episodes are mostly code. And the
code acts as a great skeleton on which to hang the concepts. Apple-R
also keeps me honest.


So, if you’re interested in how the Ruby object model really works,
and want to improve your metaprogramming chops, why not <a
