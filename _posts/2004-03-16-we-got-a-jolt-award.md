Sue Spielman just called. Apparently the <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter_kit/">Pragmatic
Starter Kit</a> just won a Jolt Productivity Award. I’m blown away: we
had some stiff competition, and the books haven’t been out that
long. I’m thinking that the judges were probably thinking what we’re
thinking: these kinds of basic skills are becoming crucially important
if we’re to keep software development competitive in this country.


Anyway, a big “thank you!” to everyone involved, and congratulations
to the winners.
