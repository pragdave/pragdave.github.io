If you use OS X, then you own an application that’ll waste hours of
your time. And it's just sitting on your hard drive.


Say hello to `Applications > Utilities > Grapher`.


We needed a simple Fourier square wave for a book. Just type in the
equations, and out it pops.


But the time wasting comes from playing with its example graphs.


Did I mention that they animate, and it can export Quicktime?
