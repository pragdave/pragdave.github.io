Brian Marick just <a
href="http://www.testing.com/cgi-bin/blog/2003/06/05#cvs">blogged</a> on
Configuration Management. He talks about how he uses CM differently in
work and personal contexts: in a work context he uses it as an audit
and exploration tool, but at home it is basically a big UNDO button.


I’m guessing that Brian primarily uses a single computer at home, or
that he has different computers dedicated to different tasks. Andy and
I don’t. I have four desktops and two laptops I use pretty regularly
(although the Powerbook has become my workhorse machine recently). And
I migrate my development between them in a pretty ad-hoc way. If I
happen to be in front of my big monitor when I realize how to add
something to RDoc, I’ll start typing in to my Linux box. If half way
through I have to take Zachary to his karate class, I’ll check in what
I have, check it back out on the Powerbook, and carry on while I wait
for him. I can work on articles, coding, books, or whatever on just
about any of my machines. If I’m in a hotel and I need something, I
can just check it out. Even this blog is stored under CVS (and served
from it as well: all I have to do to post an article is check it in).


The are many other good reasons for using source control, but freedom
from a particular hard drive is a significant one for me.
