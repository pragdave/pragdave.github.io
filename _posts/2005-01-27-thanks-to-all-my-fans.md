There’s a whole lot of work being done on monitoring the health and
status of systems using differing patterns of background
sound. Perhaps your server farm sounds like a rain forest, and a
cricket chirps every time someone portscans you.


It turns out I have one of these set up for free. I run continuous
builds for our books in production on my office G5, and the G5 fans
are very responsive to processor load. So whenever the build system
decides to rebuild a book (because an author has checked in changes),
the fans kick in, and I can wander over and see what’s cooking. It’s
surprisingly useful feedback.
