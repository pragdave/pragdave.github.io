It was standing-room only at Mike Clark’s Capistrano talk: one of the
first talks at this year’s RailsConf. Latecomers stole chairs from
other rooms and fought their way to some free floor space to hear Mike
talk about the way we deploy Rails applications. I’d just finished
giving the first keynote.


One of my topics was making deployment in Rails easier and more
amenable to corporate use. I suspect from the interest in my talk,
followed by the overwhelming interest in Mike’s talk, that deployment
will be one of the hot Rails topics of the coming year.
