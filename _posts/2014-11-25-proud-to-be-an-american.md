Twenty five years ago, I was an English software developer working on
a project for a large US company. I'd traveled down to Atlanta with
the project leader. We had a Sunday night
free, so we went up to Stone Mountain to see the show.

Back then, the show was a _son et lumière_, projected onto the massive
north face of the mountain, a face that contains a bas relief of three
confederate heroes: Jackson, Lee, and Davis. The show was rousing and
impressive event (with an engagingly southern perspective on history).
It ended with a resounding rendition of _God Bless the USA_. That's
the song with the chorus that starts _I'm proud to be an American…_.
As a Brit, I found myself with tears in my eyes. To quote Marc Cohn,
"Ma'am, I am tonight."

Six months later I married that project leader, and she moved to
England. Five years after that, we moved to the States, where we
raised our two boys, started a consulting-company-turned-publisher,
and generally settled down.

I've now lived here longer than anywhere else. The USA is my home. So
today I finished up the process of naturalization—I'm now a US
citizen.

And, during the ceremony, they played a montage video. And, yes, the
background music was Lee Greenwood singing, _God Bless the USA_.
And I stood there, tearing up again, thinking about those 25 years. 

I've lived in many countries. I've liked each in turn. But this is
where I choose to be now. It's a country of people who have chosen to
be here. It makes mistakes, then tries to fix them. It comes across as
brash, but the people have subtlety and charm. It has the energy
of youth, along with the accompanying inexperience. It's a place where
things can get done, and often redone. It's a glorious, chaotic, Great
Dane puppy of a country.

And, today, I'm proud to be an American.
