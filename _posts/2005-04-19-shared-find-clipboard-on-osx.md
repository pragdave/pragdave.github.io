Thanks to Allan Odgaard for pointing out the shared find clipboard in
OS X. Highlight text in one application and hit Command-E. Go to
another application, hit Command-G, and it searches for that text. And
all without disturbing the regular clipboard. That tip has saved me a
boatload of time over the last couple of days as Iâ€™ve been reconciling
data between various systems.
