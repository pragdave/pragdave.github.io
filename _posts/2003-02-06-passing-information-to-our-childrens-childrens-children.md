There’s a great article in the January 2003 CACM which describes some
very long-term data storage technology (_Organic Data Memory using the
DNA Approach_).


In a nutshell, you encode your information using sequences of DNA base
triplets (AAA, AAC, AAG, and so on), then splice these on to the end
of a DNA strand, making sure that the stuff you write is past that
strand’s stop codon. You then perform the necessary magic to get this
DNA into the host’s genome. That way the new material will not take
part in protein synthesis, but _will_ be passed down as genetic
material from generation to generation.


This isn’t science fiction: the researchers encoded the words of “It’s
a Small World”, added them to a bateria’s genome, then extracted the
information again. Because bacteria can withstand all kinds of abuse
(dessication, extremes of temperature, and so on), they believe that
this gives us a good long-term storage scheme. (There’s the problem of
mutations to deal with, but decent error correcting codes could
probably deal with this).


Now, of course, we’ll see the RIAA step in to the act and insist that
they need to add unique digital signatures into every human being.
