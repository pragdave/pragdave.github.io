Mike Clark’s been hunkered down for a number of months now writing the
third volume of the Starter Kit, <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/sk/auto">Pragmatic Project
Automation</a>. On Monday this week he finished the draft, and it went
out to 20 or so lucky folks for a first review. The feedback so far
has been marvelous: people really like both the content _and_ the
style (after all, lava lamps are this year’s essential project
accessory).


I’m really pleased about all this for a number of reasons. First, I’m
pleased for us. This really is a great book—practical, timely, and fun
to read. We couldn’t have asked for a better way to round out the
starter kit. I’m also pleased because automation is near and dear to
my heart, and with Mike’s book we finally have something to show
people to say “this is what we mean.” And, of course, I’m please for
Mike. Writing a book is a lot of work, and it requires a bunch of
dedication. In Mike’s case, that was tested even more, as he was the
first person to use our new typesetting toolchain.


It’s looking like the book will be available sometime in July, and I
for one can’t wait.
