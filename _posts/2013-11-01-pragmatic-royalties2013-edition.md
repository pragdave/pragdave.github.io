Back in 2009, I posted a summary of the
[royalties](/blog/2009/10/19/pragmatic-bookshelf-royalty-rates/)
we paid on our titles. Susannah, our managing
editor, has been suggesting for a while that I should update it. I was
surprised by what I found.

Here are the 2009 numbers:

Compare with 2013:

Below $10k, the numbers are about the same. That’s not
surprising—mostly they reflect the vanity titles that were around
in 2009. But above the $10k mark, things are a little different.

In 2009, 70% of titles made more than $25k. By 2013, that number has
grown to 74%.

In 2009, 41% of titles made over $50k. By 2013, it’s 46%.

And while roughly the same percentage of titles made between $75k and
$100k (12% in  2009, 13% now), there’s a big increase in the
$100–$200k wedge, up from 4% to 12%. The only drop at the top is the
>$400k wedge, and that simply reflects that we haven’t had a title as
big as the Rails and Ruby books recently, while the overall number of
titles has grown.

These numbers were pleasantly surprising. I know that as a business we
are insulated from the plummeting fortunes of more conventional
publishers. But I hadn’t realized that were were even more attractive
to authors now than back in 2009.

Maybe it’s time for you to consider <a
