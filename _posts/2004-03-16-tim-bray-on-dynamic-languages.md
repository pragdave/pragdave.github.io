Tim Bray has just <a

Sun</a> (congratulations, Sun). One of the interesting snippets in the
middle of the article was:

I wonder if Tim’s in a position to help Sun see that the drive to make
J2EE heavier and heavier will ultimately hurt them? There’s a definite
groundswell out there of folks pushing back against the monster that
is modern enterprise development (just look at the spread of the
Groovy meme, and things like Spring). Will companies like Sun and BEA
listen, or will they simply become less relevant? I’m hoping that Sun
at least listens, but I’m not holding my breath: they’ve got an awful
lot invested in the J2EE, and seem to think that the only way to move
into the future is to add even more features.


The best thing that they could do for themselves and for the
development community would be to scrap at least half of J2EE, and
move back to a more lightweight, declarative style of applications
development. Perhaps the 1.5 metadata stuff is a Trojan horse to let
them do that, but I suspect not.
