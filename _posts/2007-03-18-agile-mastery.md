I’m in London, having just finished presenting at
[QCon](http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/conference).

One of the tracks was called **Reflecting on our Agile Journey—How
do we reach Mastery?** The more I think about that, the more the title
worries me, because it seems to contain an implicit assumption—that
mastery is some state that can be reached.

I think there are methodologies which can be mastered, where you can
say “now I know it all.” I don’t believe agility is in that camp. For
me, agility is all about the journey. Along the way, we’ll always be
faced with forks in the road. The agile principles help us decide
which to take. And we just carry on, enjoying the trip and doing our
best along the way.
