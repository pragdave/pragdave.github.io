In the [previous post](/blog/2007/12/30/pipelines-using-fibers-in-ruby-19/), I developed
a class called `PipelineElement`. This made it relatively easy to
create elements that act as producers and filters in a programmatic
pipeline. Using it, we could write Ruby 1.9 code like:

``` ruby
10.times do
  puts (evens | multiples_of_three | multiples_of_seven).resume
end
```

The construct in the loop is a pipeline containing three chunks of
code: a generator of even numbers, a filter that only passes multiples
of three, and another filter that passes multiples of seven. Numbers
are passed from the producer to the first filter, and then from that
filter to the next, until finally popping out and being made available
to `puts`.

However, creating these pipeline elements is still something of a
pain. It turns out that we can simplify things when it comes to
creating filters. In the implementation I’ll show here, we’ll only
handle the case of simple _transforming filters_—filters that take an
input, do something to it, and write the result to the filter chain.

Let’s revisit the `PipelineElement` class

``` ruby
class PipelineElement

   attr_accessor :source

   def initialize
     @fiber_delegate = Fiber.new do
       process
     end
   end

   def |(other)
     other.source = self
     other
   end

   def resume
     @fiber_delegate.resume
   end

   def process
     while value = input
       handle_value(value)
     end
   end

   def handle_value(value)
     output(value)
   end

   def input
     source.resume
   end

   def output(value)
     Fiber.yield(value)
   end
 end
```

The `process` method is the driving loop. It reads the next input from
the pipeline, then calls`handle_value` to deal with it. In the base
class, `handle_value` simply echoes the input to the output-real
filters subclass `PipelineElement` and subclass this method.

Let’s make a small change to the `handle_value` method.

``` ruby
def handle_value(value)
  output(transform(value))
end

def transform(value)
  value
end
```

By doing this, we’ve split the transformation of the incoming value
into a separate method. And the work done by this method no longer
uses any of the state in the PipelineElement object, which means we
can also do it in a block in the caller’s context. Let’s change
our `PipelineElement` class to allow this. We’ll have the constructor
take an optional block, and we’ll use that block in preference to
the`transform`. Here’s another listing, showing just the changed
methods.

``` ruby
class PipelineElement

  def initialize(&block)
    @transformer = block || method(:transform)
    @fiber_delegate = Fiber.new do
      process
    end
  end

  # ...

  def handle_value(value)
    output(@transformer.call(value))
  end
end
```

This illustrates a cool (and underused) feature of Ruby. Method
objects (created with the `method(...)`call) are duck-typed with proc
objects: we can use `.call(params)` on both. This is a great way of
letting users of a class change its behavior either by subclassing and
overriding a method, or by simply passing in a block.

With this change in place, we can now write transforming filters using
blocks. This is a lot more compact that the previous subclassing
approach.

``` ruby
class Evens < PipelineElement
  def process
    value = 0
    loop do
      output(value)
      value += 2
    end
  end
end

evens = Evens.new

tripler     = PipelineElement.new {|val| val * 3}
incrementer = PipelineElement.new {|val| val + 1}

5.times do
  puts (evens | tripler | incrementer ).resume
end
```

This outputs 1, 7, 13, 19, and 25.

### Different Kinds of Filter

This approach works well if all we want is transforming filters. But
what if we would also like to simplify filters that either pass of
don’t pass values based on some criteria? A block would seem like a
great way of specifying the condition, but we’ve already used our one
block parameter up. Subclassing to the rescue. We can create two
subclasses, `Transformer` and `Filter`. One sets
the `@transformer` instance variable to any block it is passed. The
other sets `@filter`. Here’s the relevant code:

``` ruby
class PipelineElement

  attr_accessor :source

  def initialize(&block)
    @transformer  ||= method(:transform)
    @filter       ||= method(:filter)
    @fiber_delegate = Fiber.new do
      process
    end
  end

  # ...

  def handle_value(value)
    output(@transformer.call(value)) if @filter.call(value)
  end

  def transform(value)
    value
  end

  def filter(value)
    true
  end
end

class Transformer < PipelineElement
  def initialize(&block)
    @transformer = block
    super
  end
end

class Filter < PipelineElement
  def initialize(&block)
    @filter = block
    super
  end
end
```

Thus equipped, we can write:

``` ruby
tripler          = Transformer.new {|val| val * 3}
incrementer      = Transformer.new {|val| val + 1}
multiple_of_five = Filter.new {|val| val % 5 == 0}

5.times do
  puts (evens | tripler | incrementer | multiple_of_five ).resume
end
```

### Moving The Blocks Inline

Our final hack lets us move the blocks directly into the pipeline.

Let’s look at the actual pipeline code:

``` ruby
puts (evens | tripler | incrementer | multiple_of_five ).resume
```

Those pipe characters are simply calls to the | method in
class `PipelineElement`. And methods can take block arguments, right?
So what stops us writing

``` ruby
puts (evens | {|v| v*3} | {|v| v+1} | multiple_of_five ).resume

```

It turns out that Ruby stops us. The brace characters are taken to be
hash parameters, not blocks, so Ruby gets its knickers in a
twist. Fortunately, that’s easily fixed by making the method calls
explicit.

``` ruby
puts (evens .| {|v| v*3} .| {|v| v+1} .| multiple_of_five ).resume
```

Now we just need to make the | method accept an optional block. If the
block is present, we use it to create a new transformer.

``` ruby
def |(other=nil, &block)
  other = Transformer.new(&block) if block
  other.source = self
  other
end
```

Ruby 1.9 lets you chain method calls across lines, so we can tidy up
our pipeline visually.

``` ruby
5.times do
  puts (evens 
        .| {|v| v*3}
        .| {|v| v+1}
        .| multiple_of_five 
       ).resume
end
```

###A Palindrome Finder

Let’s finish with another trivial example. We’ll create a generic
producer class that takes a collection and passes it, one element at a
time, into the pipeline.

``` ruby
class Pump < PipelineElement
  def initialize(source)
    @source = source
    super()
  end
  def process
    @source.each {|item| Fiber.yield item}
    nil
  end
end

```



Now we can write a simple palindrome finder (a palindrome is a word which is the same when spelled backwards).



```
words = Pump.new %w{Madam, the civic radar rotator is not level.}
is_palindrome = Filter.new {|word| word == word.reverse}

pipeline = words .| {|word| word.downcase.tr("^a-z", '') } .| is_palindrome

while word = pipeline.resume
  puts word
end

```



This outputs: madam, civic, radar, rotator, level.


But what if we instead want to show each word in the input stream, and flag it if it is a palindrome? That’s easily done, but we won’t do it the easy way. Instead, let’s show a more convoluted method, because it might be useful in the general case.


There’s no law to say that a transformer that receives a string as input has to write a string as output. It could, if it wanted to, write an array. Or a structure. So we could write:



```
WordInfo = Struct.new(:original, :forwards, :backwords)

words = Pump.new %w{Madam, the civic radar rotator is not level.}

normalize = Transformer.new {|word| [word, word.downcase.tr("^a-z", '')] }

to_word_info = Transformer.new do |word, normalized|
  reversed = normalized.reverse
  WordInfo.new(word, normalized, reversed)
end

formatter = Transformer.new do |word_info|
  if word_info.forwards == word_info.backwords
    "'#{word_info.original}' is a palindrome"
  else
    "'#{word_info.original}' is not a palindrome"
  end
end

pipeline = words | normalize | to_word_info | formatter

while word = pipeline.resume
  puts word
end

```

This outputs

```
'Madam,' is a palindrome
'the' is not a palindrome
'civic' is a palindrome
'radar' is a palindrome
'rotator' is a palindrome
'is' is not a palindrome
'not' is not a palindrome
'level.' is a palindrome

```

### So, What’s the Point?

Is this a great way of writing a palindrome finder? Not really. But…


What we’ve done here is turned the way a program works on it’s
head. We’ve written chunks of isolated code, each of which either
filters or transforms an input. We’ve then independently knitted these
chunks together. That’s a high degree of decoupling. We can also leave
it until runtime to determine what gets put into the pipeline (and the
order that it appears in the pipeline), which means we can move more
power into the hands of our users.


Could we have done all this without Fibers? Of course. Could we do it
without Ruby 1.9? Absolutely. But sometimes factors come together
which lead us to experiment with new ways of thinking about our code.


This pipeline stuff is not revolutionary, and it isn’t generally
applicable. But it’s fun to play with. And, for me, that’s the main
thing.


### A  Wee Postscript


All this content is stuff that I decided not to include in the <a
href="http://pragprog.com/titles/ruby3">third edition of the
PickAxe</a>. It didn’t work in the section on fibers, because it uses
programming techniques not yet covered. It didn’t work later because,
as an example of various programming techniques, it is just too long.
