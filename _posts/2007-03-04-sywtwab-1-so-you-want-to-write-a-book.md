This is the first of a series of personal notes to people who may be
thinking of writing (or who have embarked upon writing) a book. You’ll
be able to find them all (eventually) by selecting the tag

I don’t pretend to know too much about writing in general, but I have
learned what works for me, and what seems to work for most Pragmatic
Bookshelf authors. Don’t take this series as a set of rules—at best
treat it as something to think about if you’re considering launching
into a book. And I’m sure Andy and our editors will have different
(and better) perspectives.


Let’s start at the beginning. With the motivation.

Now that I’m a book publisher (albeit an accidental one), I quite
often get folks coming to me saying “I want to write a book.” I
typically answer with a single question:

> “Why?”

It might appear to be one of those annoying flip responses, but it
honestly isn’t. The answer to the question “why?” is the best
indicator I know for whether the author will actually end up with a
finished book.

Some people treat writing a book as some kind of rite of passage. They
say “I’ve always felt I have a book in me, and now’s the time to get
it out.” This is the book-as-romantic-journey ideal. These people are
unlikely to finish—the bloom will have left the rose well before the
third rewrite of chapter six.

Some people answer that they want to write a book to help them with
their consulting or training businesses. This answer is almost 180º
wrong. Books are not collateral for your business. You are the
collateral—people come to the business because of you. If you don’t
have the experience that people want, writing a book won’t fix
that. The book will follow your reputation, not make it.

Some people have some new framework or library that they want to
document in a book. They feel that having printed documentation will
add credibility to their project. But that’s not really what books are
for. Books certainly can be useful adjuncts to a project, but they
really suck as API documentation—by the time the book is in your local
bookstore the chances are the project will have moved on and your
1,500 method API listing will be out of date.

So what’s a good answer? I personally look for three things.

**Passion**. First and foremost, an author needs to be passionate
about the subject. They’ll love it, warts and all. They’ll live
it—it will take up their free time. They’ll be wired into the
community—they’ll be known by the readers of mailing lists. They may
well have a blog where they talk about their interest.


**Evangelism**. Just being passionate is not enough. Good authors also
have a mission: they want the rest of the world to share their
joy. They want to spread the knowledge to as many as people as
possible, using as many channels as possible. It’s not that they
want to tell people what to think or what technology to use. No,
they have this zeal because their subject makes them happy, and they
want to share this joy with others. They honesty feel the world will
be a better place once their book is written.


**Practical knowledge**. Good books are not written from an ivory
tower. You can’t just read the existing FAQs and online
documentation, then write a world-class book about some topic. You
have to have used it, and used it a lot. You need to know the good
and the bad; the areas where it helps, and the areas to avoid. Why?
Because that’s your value to your readers. Remember, your passion is
to help people do something better. Unless you have practical
experience, you’re unlikely to be able to do that—readers will soon
realize that you aren’t authoritative.

OK, so I’ve spilled the beans. Does this now mean that the Pragmatic
Bookshelf will get inundated with proposals written to push my hot
buttons? I hope not, because prospective authors who do that are
really just fooling themselves. They may get a book accepted, but our
experience over the last 4 years is that they probably won’t finish
their book project.

But, if you have the passion, and you feel driven to share your
experience with others, there’s little more satisfying than seeing a
your ideas on the shelves of your favorite bookstore.

In the next two posts, we’ll look at the Hero’s Journey, the basis of
most good technical books.
