    <p>
    We seem to have forgotten what agility is all about. As one of the
      authors of the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org">Agile Manifesto</a>,

    </p>
    <p>
    This talk is a (slightly cynical) analysis of the forces that are
    destroying the meaning of agility, and a suggestion on how we
    should recapture it.

    Ruby helps to endear it to its users.
